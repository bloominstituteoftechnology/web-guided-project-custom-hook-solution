# Sprint 1 - Module 3 : Custom Hooks Lesson Plan

## [Training Kit](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Full-Stack-Web-Curriculum/tree/main/03-WebApplications-II/Sprint%2001%20-%20Advanced%20React/Module%203%20-%20Composing%20and%20Sharing%20Non-Visual%20Behaviors)

----

## Objectives

By the end of this module, learners should be able to:
* define stateful logic
* apply non-visual behavior (stateful logic) with custom hooks
* compose hooks in a custom hook to extend multiple pieces of stateful logic

## Check for Understanding Questions

These are the questions used internally to check student understanding. Students will be instructed to answer these questions after the guided project. Please make sure to emphasize the concepts behind these answers.

#### Which of the following would NOT be considered "stateful logic"?
* event handler functions
* const [players, setPlayers] = useState([])
* **h2 className="sub-header">Hello /h2**
* fetching data from an API

#### If you had a custom hook called useWindowSize whose return value was [height, width], how would you use this hook in your component?
* const [height, width] = useState();
* const [height] = useHeight(); const [width] = useWidth();
* **const [height, width] = useWindowSize();**
* const [width, height] = useWindowSize();

#### Custom hooks should be named with "use" at the start of the name.
* FALSE
* **TRUE**

#### What is it called when you call a React hook (custom or not) inside a custom hook that you are building?
* creating a custom hook
* **composing hooks**
* calling hooks
* mounting


## Guided Project Outline

### Introduce Module:
* Explain that we will now be pivoting back to functional components.
* This lesson will be more about application architecture.
* We will start by discussion, not just stateful logic, but how we break down an application into ALL it component parts.

### Defining Stateful Logic.
* Discuss what stateful logic is.
* Discuss why should we even want to identify stateful logic.
* Highlight Dryness, Organization, Reusablity. 

### Introduce Separation of Concerns
* Discuss seperation of concerns.
* Highlight any one piece of code should ultimately do one thing and be kept in a seperate file.
* Highlight the different types of logic within a given piece of React code.

### Walk through presentational refactoring.
* Open up review project and note the App.js
* Discussion how we would modularize our presentation into subcomponents.
* Checkout review-presentational branch.
* Note that because we have refactored, we need to pass values in through props.
* Note the flexibility of using components.
* Note the hierarchy of files created.

### Walkthrough service refactoring.
* Create a new function that handles service for getAllPoke.
* Create a new function that handles service for get an indivisual pokemon.
* Modularize our service code as well.
* Highlight the difference between export default and export.

### Walkthrough state refactoring.
* Highlight that we still have code that has to do with something other then presentation of based components: Stateful logic.
* Custom Hooks are our method of encapliating stateful behavior.
* Create a custom hook
  1. Define usePokeState passing in the initial value of state.
  2. Add in all defintions of our pokemon stateful logic.
  3. Return all needed functions and data to our App code.
* Show review-hooks branch.
* Discuss the advatages of new style.
* Review the advantages of modularized style of code and the refactoring process.

### BREAK

### Walkthrough FollowAlong Project
* Show the form project itself
* Show the form project solution, highlighting multiple fields and persistance.
* Walk through App.js and Signup form.

### Create a base custom hook
* Explain again that we are seperating out custom logic.
* Work with students to create useForm hook
  1. Define useForm passing in the initial value of state.
  2. Add in all defintions of our pokemon stateful logic.
  3. Return all needed functions and data to our App code.
* Impliment useForm hook.

### Generalize useForm
* Show the problems that come with creating new fields.
* Highlight the importance of generalization.
* Implment generalization of useForm with students:
  1. Change data's specific name to a value.
  2. Change set method's specific name to a setValue.
  3. Create initial value and setup hook to accept an object of form values.
  4. Highlight that we now need to return a object. Type of initialState matches type of returned value.
  5. Update setValue to work with multiple fields:
  ```js
  setValue({
    ...value,
    [e.target.name]:e.target.value
  })
  ```
  6. Update name to values.
  7. Modulerize code.

### BREAK

### Introduction to persistance through localStorage
* Note that we also have presistance to add.
* Introduce localStorage.
  1. localStorage.setItem(key, value)
  2. localStorage.getItem(key, value)
  3. Note the result inside of the Application tab of developer tools.
  4. Note that localStorage is saved by the url.
  5. Note that it is not unlike cookies.
  6. localStorage.removeItem
* Show how localStorage can be added to initialValues as a test.
* Show it works even when reloading.
* Note that it only get strings.
* Show the need for JSON.stringify and JSON.parse for object retrieval.


### Introduce the idea of a localStorage Hook
* Explain that when using persistance, we have data saved in two different places: Database and Local State.
* Explain that when we can tie those to processes together using a custom hook.

### Build localStorage hook in the useForm folder.
* Handle the building of the function
1. Build function useLocalStorage.
2. Pass in initialValue.
3. Create state.

* Add the process for retrieving from localStorage
1. Introduce the passing of a function into useState.
2. Add conditional to check if localStorage exists and if do, return that value.
3. If not in localStorage, add to it and return initialValue.
4. Make sure you pass in the key.

* Add the process for setting localStorage
1. Remember we are returning a version of setValue.
2. In setValue, set the value in state.
3. Set the value in localStorage.
4. return setValue and value.

* Compose hooks using in useForm using localStorage hook.
1. Replace useState with useLocalStorage.
2. Be sure to pass in 'form' key.
3. Test.

* Note the seemlessness of custom hooks when applied to state hook. This is the power of composing hooks.

* Modularize localStorage.
